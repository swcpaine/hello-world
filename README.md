# hello-world
general ideas, info and a little about me


I am a PhD Research Student at the University of Southampton and I am looking to start using some coding for my research project. This will mainly be within R - and as I am new to coding I will be using GitHub for colaboration with colleagues to make sure that I am doing OK.
